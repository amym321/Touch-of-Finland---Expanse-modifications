<p>The marvelously absorbent Swedish dish cloths are a wonder in the kitchen. You'll never want to go back to sponges or regular cloths when you see how they work. They soften when wet &amp; wash &amp; dry like a dream. Kitchen surfaces are virtually streak-free. Made of 70% cellulose and 30% cotton, they're durable (just wash them in your washing machine). And since they are all natural you can even compost them should you tire of them. They're more sanitary than sponges - they dry out more quickly. Use them instead of paper towels to blot up spills -- they absorb 15 times their weight in water. And the motifs will give your kitchen a Scandinavian accent!</p>

<p><br><strong>The History of the Swedish Dishcloth</strong><br><br>Back in 1949 a Swedish man engineered a new material out of natural &amp; renewable fibers. The Swedish dishcloth follows Scandinavian tradition of form and function -- which must be why it is used all over Scandinavia. In Scandinavia, it is common for dish towels to be reused. Across the Nordic, paper towels are rarely used. Scandinavians follow the motto of reuse and recycle naturally.</p>
<p><br><strong>Replaces paper towels + sponges</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0643/4389/files/replace.jpg?v=1474486098" alt=""><br>These cloths are a huge hit with Eco-conscious and cost driven consumers. Replace paper towel with Swedish dishcloths - one of these cellulose &amp; cotton dishtowels does the work of 17 rolls of paper toweling! Swedish dishcloths are more durable and hygienic than a slow-to-dry, bacteria-ridden sponge. Each individual Swedish dishcloth can be thrown in the dishwasher (top rack) or washing machine for over 200 cycles!</p>
