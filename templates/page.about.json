My Grandpa was working at the local mine. My Father was a school teacher and an aspiring entrepreneur. Mother stayed at home to take care of the growing family.<br\/><br\/>A few months later, my grandparents and parents were given the opportunity to join together and purchase the then closing FinnKraft store. In May of 1981 the store opened under the new name Touch of Finland.<br\/><br\/>A decade later, my grandparents retired from business and sold their shares to my parents. The next ten years were spent innovating and growing the business while my parents also raised a young family of seven.<\/p><p><br\/>In 2007, Dad & Mom retired and I took over the business. Following in my parents footsteps, I continued expanding and importing goods from Finland while starting a new online webstore. <\/p><p>Now today, Touch of Finland continues to operate out of the same store in Marquette, MI.<\/p><p>- Bryan, Owner<\/p><p><\/p>"}}},"block_order":["1633450047113d8590-0","1633450047113d8590-1"],"settings":{"align_text":"center","narrow_column":true,"color_scheme":"none","divider":false}},"1633460363360e82bf":{"type":"testimonials","blocks":{"1633460363360e82bf-0":{"type":"testimonial","settings":{"icon":"quote","testimonial":"<p>Iâ€™ve ordered several items for Christmas gifts.
